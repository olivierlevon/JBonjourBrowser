Java BonjourBrowser

An application like Bonjour Browser is necessary to view the services that are present and being announced in a network where devices are Bonjour-capable. While Bonjour Browser does a very good job on the Mac OS X platform, we will need an application that can work similarly, display all services and run on several platforms. Hence it was necessary to build a tool like Bonjour Browser in Java that could run on multiple platforms.
A tool like Bonjour Browser is especially helpful while troubleshooting service discovery in the IRT Lab's 7DS research, since the project involves mobile disconnected networks where devices are often very transient and services are announced and disappear shortly afterwards.
